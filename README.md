### The intention of this project was to scrape country demographic information from Wikipedia. This was a multi-step process with the following goals:
1. To scrape a table from [a page in Wikipedia that lists countries by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population) which also contains links to the pages containing each country's demographics.
2. To take the country name and link and save it to a csv file.
3. to read the csv file back in as a dataframe and scrape each of the links to the individual country page for important demographic information such as population, life expectancy, density, birth rate, death rate, etc.  
4. To then store these country demographics in a CSV file.
